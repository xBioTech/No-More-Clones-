## Overview

### The project

I encountered a problem at work where I was provided with large lists containing storage locations and part numbers with duplicates in it. These lists were used to check the storage locations in our warehouse for correct part numbers and quantities. However, the presence of duplicates made the task challenging and time-consuming. To address this issue, I developed a program that efficiently filters out all duplicate entries from the lists, enabling me to focus on verifying the accuracy of part numbers and quantities without the interference of redundant data.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

- keep an eye open for tasks i can automate with my skills to safe time and effort
- how to return a new set of unique values
- open up print window with JavaScript

I added some small code snippets below to illustrate my workwise

```javascript
function removeClones(input) {
  return [...new Set(input.split("\n"))];
}

function printOutput() {
  window.print();
}
```

## Got feedback for me?

I'm always down for some feedback! I'm constantly striving to improve my coding skills and take them to the next level, so if you have any thoughts or suggestions, don't hesitate to hit me up via email or Discord.

Thanks a ton for your help, and let's blast off together :rocket:
